As a fan of all things witchy including tarot, it is difficult to find a good website to keep track of our readings and learn from them. This website does exactly that! It will allow the user to enter cards they drew and their interpretations. This is still very much a work in progress. I want to create something useful to me that would passionate me and keep me coding actively! Additionaly I added my own tarot deck made by myself with the help of the Midjourney AI
